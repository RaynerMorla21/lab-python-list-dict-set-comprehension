    "In the previous exercise, you developed a program to manage customer orders and inventory. Now, let's take it a step further and incorporate comprehension into your code.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Review your code from the previous exercise and identify areas where you can apply comprehension to simplify and streamline your code. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - *Hint: Apply it to initialize inventory, updating the inventory and printing the updated inventory.*\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - For example, in initializing the inventory, we could have:\n",
    "    \n",
    "        ```python\n",
    "        def initialize_inventory(products):\n",
    "            inventory = {product: int(input(f\"Enter the quantity of {product}s available: \")) for product in products}\n",

    "2. Modify the function get_customer_orders so it prompts the user to enter the number of customer orders and gathers the product names using a loop and user input. Use comprehension.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Add a new function to calculate the total price of the customer order. For each product in customer_orders, prompt the user to enter the price of that product. Use comprehension to calculate the total price. Note: assume that the user can only have 1 unit of each product.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Modify the update_inventory function to remove the product from the inventory if its quantity becomes zero after fulfilling the customer orders. Use comprehension to filter out the products with a quantity of zero from the inventory.\n",

    "5. Print the total price of the customer order.\n",
